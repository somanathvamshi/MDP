                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect
                    the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that
                    cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold
                    weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to
                    become sick with these viruses during other months.&nbsp;
                    There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,
                    severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and
                    investigations are ongoing.

                    Community spread means people have been infected with the
                    virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or
                    where they became infected. Each health department

                    In healthcare settings across the United States, donated
                    blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for
                    patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood
                    centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC
                    encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood
                    if they are able, even if they are practicing social
                    distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood
                    centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors
                    and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include
                    spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to
                    environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to
                    make donation appointments ahead of time.

                    Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19
                    and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19
                    have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all
                    (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with
                    COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain
